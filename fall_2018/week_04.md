## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I started learning more about JavaScript, as it is hard to learn about Node.js without knowing JavaScript

## This Week's Plan

> I will continue learning JavaScript in depth, taking notes on it, and completing practice exercises.

## Anything Blocking?

> Nothing is blocking me right now.

## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.
