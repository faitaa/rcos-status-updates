## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I started learning more about JavaScript, as it is hard to learn about Node.js without knowing JavaScript.
> I completed my notes on (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript "A re-introduction to JavaScript").
> Topics covered last week included Operators, Control Structures, Objects, Arrays, Functions, Custom Objects, and Closures.
> My notes can be found in the codingandcommunity/RCOSReactcurriculum repository (Ava Branch) within the Written Notes folder.

## This Week's Plan

> I will continue learning JavaScript in depth, taking notes on it, and completing practice exercises.
> I will do this by working on Codecademy tutorials, as this will give me more hands on experience with the concepts that I read about in the reading I've been working on.
> I hope to have a much better understanding of the main concepts of JavaScript in the next two weeks and to be able to dive into Node after that.

## Anything Blocking?

> Nothing is blocking me right now.  I have actually gotten a bit more comfortable with Git, although I am still not a master.
