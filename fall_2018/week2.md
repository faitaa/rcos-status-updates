## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I used git for the first time! I committed my weekly update.  
> I also started looking into Node.js and have decided that I will probably need to gain a better understanding of JavaScript before continuing with anything related to node.

> Examples:
> Bug fixes, Features added, Links to Issues, Links to Pull-Requests, Lightning Talks, Bonus Sessions

## This Week's Plan

> This week, I'm going to start looking more into JavaScript.  I will look up online tutorials and take notes in the next couple of weeks. 
> I think that will make it much easier to understand Node.

> Examples: New Bugs to be fixed, Design choices

## Anything Blocking?

> The only trouble that I'm having so far is that I don't really understand git sitll.

> Examples: Confusion on how to approach a problem, Limited experience with a specific technology

## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.
