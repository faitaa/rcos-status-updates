## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Last week, we started working on our presentation and thinking about what points we wanted to discuss during it.  This was a bit of a challenge because there are so many of us.
> I spent some time reflecting on what I have worked on this semester and thinking about how to get that across within the time limit.
> In order to speak about our team's work overall, I had to catch up a bit on what everyone else has worked on as well, as we have all been working somewhat independently.

## This Week's Plan

> This week, I will focus on the presentation that is coming up this Friday.  I will practice what I am going to say and make small tweaks to the slide I am presenting.
> I also plan on continuing my learning of JavaScript this week, as that was put on the back burner last week while I focused on the presentation.

## Anything Blocking?

> I am having a bit of trouble with managing my time, as classes and work have picked up. Time has definitely been my biggest struggle the past couple of weeks.
> I plan on taking advantage of the casual coding session this week in order to make sure I am spending enough time on this project outside of normal group meetings.
 
## Notes

> I have been committing my notes on JavaScript to git just to show that I am indeed spending time on this.  
> I was not doing this before, as I did not know that this was something I should do but from now on, I will commit any work I do in tutorials.
