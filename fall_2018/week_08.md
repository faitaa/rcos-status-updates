## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Last week, we started working on our presentation and thinking about what points we wanted to discuss during it.  This was a bit of a challenge because there are so many of us.
> I spent some time reflecting on what I have worked on this semester and thinking about how to get that across within the time limit.
> In order to speak about our team's work overall, I had to catch up a bit on what everyone else has worked on as well, as we have all been working somewhat independently.
> I was also able to solve my Create React App issue! I did this with the help of some of my teammates and was able to complete the Tic Tac Toe tutorial.
> The files for the tutorial can be found in my branch of the RCOSReactCurriculum repository.

## This Week's Plan

> This week, I will focus on the presentation that is coming up this Friday.  I will practice what I am going to say and make small tweaks to the slide I am presenting.
> I also plan on continuing my learning of React this week.  I will write up my notes on the Tic Tac Toe tutorial and begin working on finding more tutorials to work on over the break.

## Anything Blocking?

> I am having a bit of trouble with managing my time, as classes and work have picked up. Time has definitely been my biggest struggle the past couple of weeks.
> I plan on taking advantage of the casual coding session this week in order to make sure I am spending enough time on this project outside of normal group meetings.
 
## Notes

> It might not seem like I hae been doing much, as I don't have a ton of commits but I am really working on learning the material for this, so that I can jump right in next semester with actually formulating the curriculum.
> This was a lot for me to learn this semester, as I previously had no experience with Git, JavaScript, or React, so I definitely spent a lot of time making sure I was really comfortable with the material.
