## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I began looking at React in order to be able to contribute more to the curriculum at this point in time.  I also started to learn more JavaScript concepts. 

## This Week's Plan

> I'm going to dive into the React tutorials in the Slack channel so that I can begin contributing to the tutorial feedback document.

## Anything Blocking?

> Only thing blocking me right now is that I don't know JavaScript too well yet but I am working on learning more.  

## Notes

> I don't plan on abandoning Node.js but as of right now, I feel I can contribute the most to this team if I start learning React.
