## This Week's Plan

> After some thought and discussion with members of the Curriculum group, I have decided that learning React would actually be mor valuable for my team than if I learned Node.
> Since the React curriculum is what we are currently working on, I think my input would be more useful if I took the time to learn about it.  
> This week, I am going to begin diving into React, now that I have a much better understanding of JavaScript.
> I will document my opinions on any tutorials I do and start brainstorming some ideas for potential projects. 

## Anything Blocking?

> Nothing is currently blocking my work.  

## Notes

> I don't plan on abandoning Node.js but as of right now, I feel I can contribute the most to this team if I start learning React.
