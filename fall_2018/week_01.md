## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Last week I was assigned to the Framework Expert Team.  This means that I will be responsible for learning a certain framework and being able to start making decisions about how the curriculum will be made and formatted.  
> I also began learning how to use git.  I didn't even previously have an account so I have had to learn a lot. I made an account then started reading about how git works on various websites.

> Examples:
> Bug fixes, Features added, Links to Issues, Links to Pull-Requests, Lightning Talks, Bonus Sessions

## This Week's Plan

> Since I have to learn about the NodeJS framework, I have decided that a good place to start will be with learning basic JavaScript concepts.  

> I have no previous experience with JavaScript so I will have a lot of learning to do this semester.

> Examples: New Bugs to be fixed, Design choices

## Anything Blocking?

> Right now the only thing blocking me is the fact that I still don't really know how to use git.
> I will continue trying to learn.

> Examples: Confusion on how to approach a problem, Limited experience with a specific technology

## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.
