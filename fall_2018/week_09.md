## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Last week, I worked a lot on typing up my notes in order to show what I've worked on all semester.  
> I also worked more on learning about React and completed my notes on the Tic Tac Toe tutorial.  
> A big focus of mine lately has been trying to make sure that I am documenting everything that I have done so that it can reflect in my grade.  
> Being a beginner in the world of RCOS and Computer Science, I wasn't really sure what to expect out of this group and how I should be showing everything that I'm working on, especially because a lot of what I did was just learning and taking notes.  
> I also worked on the presentation a lot last week and on practicing it.  
 
## This Week's Plan

> This week, I am really focusing on typing up all of my notes and making sure I have everything on GitHub so that I can be graded properly. 
> I just requested access to add a branch on codingandcommunity/RCOSReactcurriculum so that I can put all of my stuff there.  
> I am going to focus on getting everything on there this week, before the deadline for commits.

## Anything Blocking?

> I was blocked from putting my notes and exercises on codingandcommunity/RCOSReactcurriculum because I didn't have access, but I think that is being worked on, as I reached out to Milena earlier.

## Notes

> Part of today's meeting was spent discussing future plans and the other part was spent helping our groupmates who will be presenting on Friday with their presentation.
