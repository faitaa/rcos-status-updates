## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Last week, I started looking at JavaScript guides and tutorials online.
> I decided that I would start out by reading through (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript "A re-introduction to JavaScript") and taking very thorough notes.  
> My notes can be found in the codingandcommunity/RCOSReactcurriculum repository (Ava Branch) within the Written Notes folder.
> Last week, I covered the Overview, Numbers, Strings, Other Types, and Variables sections of the reading.

## This Week's Plan

> This week, I'm going to continue (and hopefully finish) with my notes on JavaScript from the aforementioned reading.
> The topics I hope to cover this week are Operators, Control Structures, Objects, Arrays, Functions, Custom Objects, and Closures.
> My notes for this weeks will also get saved in the Writted Notes folder.
> I will also work on trying to understand the situations in which I will want to use JavaScript, by reading about it online.

## Anything Blocking?

> My current lack of knowledge about git is blocking me a bit, but that is getting better.
> Also, I currently feel like I am understanding the concepts of JavaScript, but not really understanding the big picture (i.e., when do I use it/why/how to I implement)
