## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I downloaded NodeJS and began looking at tutorials.

> Examples:
> Bug fixes, Features added, Links to Issues, Links to Pull-Requests, Lightning Talks, Bonus Sessions

## This Week's Plan

> This week, I'm going to work on more Node.js tutorials.  I will hopefully begin working on some sort of small project to get to know bot Node.js and git better.

> Examples: New Bugs to be fixed, Design choices

## Anything Blocking?

> Nothing is blocking my work at the moment other than my current lack of knowledge about git, but that is getting better.

> Examples: Confusion on how to approach a problem, Limited experience with a specific technology

## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.
