## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I completed the tic tac toe tutorial on the react website!  This involved some very basic JS concepts like variables.

## This Week's Plan

> This week, I am going to continue learning JavaScript and brainstorming possible project ideas as I go.  I think a great way to develop a curriculum is to put yourself in the shoes of a student, which is kind of what I'm doing here.

> I hope to gain a better understanding of do-while loops because this is a concept which I have not previously been exposed to

## Anything Blocking?

> Nothing is really blocking me right now except my workload this week.  

## Notes

> I had an interview question about JavaScript last week!  Can definitely see why it's important to learn.
