## Last Week's Accomplishments

> The first thing that I had to deal with last week was understanding how to even start a project using React.
> I found out that this was going to be harder than I thought and ended up having to ask a groupmate for help.
> The majority of my week last week was spent making sure I have all of the necessary things downloaded and then working on the Tic Tac Toe tutorial.


## This Week's Plan

> This week, I plan on figuring out how to commit my work on the Tic Tac Toe tutorial and writing up my feelings about the tutorial.
> I will also hopefully continue becoming more comfortable with React by completing even more tutorials.  
> My plan for this week's meeting is to find out what tutorials other people in my group have been doing and work on some of those.

## Anything Blocking?

> I am still having some trouble figuring out how to move my files around. 
> I used Create React App to do this tutorial and it automatically created project in my cygwin64 folder.  
> When I try to move it elsewhere, it says that it is open somewhere but I don't understand where. 
> I think these issues might stem from me not fully understanding how Create React App works but I plan on discussing this with people in my group this week.

## Notes

> I had an interview question about JavaScript last week!  Can definitely see why it's important to learn.
