## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Last week, we began discussing different ways we could teach the different concepts that we're looking at and ways we can encompass them all in a large project.
> We have a google doc where people are adding their feedback on the tutorials.  Because I'm just getting started with the tutorials, I decided to be the one taking notes while people were discussing.
> These notes can be found in the Ava branch of the RCOSReactcurriculum, in the 'Meeting Notes' folder.
> I started out with React by first reading a bit about it on reactjs.org.  

## This Week's Plan

> This week, I will complete the Tic Tac Toe tutorial on reactjs.org.  
> According to the website, this is a good start for someone who likes to learn by doing, which I do like.
> While working on this tutorial and after it is complete, I will take notes on my opinions of it, what I think it did well, an what I thik could have been better.
> My notes on this tutorial will be saved in the Ava branch of the RCOSReactcurriculum, in the 'Tic Tac Toe' folder.

## Anything Blocking?

> Nothing is blocking me at this time.
