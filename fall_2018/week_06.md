## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Last week, we bagan discussing different ways we could teach the different concepts that we're looking at and ways we can encompass them all in a large project.

## This Week's Plan

> This week, I am shifting my focus from node.js to react.js.  I think this will be more useful and relevant for our project and will allow me to have more input.

## Anything Blocking?

> Nothing is blocking me at this time.
